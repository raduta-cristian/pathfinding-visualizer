# pathfinding-visualizer
Visualizer app made in Unity that demonstrates, step-by-step, how certain pathfinding algorithms work. Draw your own maze and change the speed of the simulation as you please!

HOW TO USE:

1. Create a map -- use the map tools to draw walls and set the start/ending point, or just select one of 6 presets avaiable
