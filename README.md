# Pathfinding Visualizer -- \[ Unity Engine / C# \]
## Visualizer app made in Unity that demonstrates, step-by-step, how certain pathfinding algorithms work. Draw your own maze and change the speed of the simulation as you please!

*To better understand pathfinding algoritms, it's important to visualize each step they take. Watch how some of these algorithms perform better (or waaay worse) than others.*

**Features**:
- Create a map/maze -- use the map tools to draw walls and set the start/ending point
- Map Presets -- select one of 6 presets avaiable instead of drawing
- Set simulation speed
- 5 pathfinding algorithms -- choose one to test
- Performance statistics -- see how many cells were searched and how long the calculated path is
